# ExampleCalculatorRb

Write calculations using functions and get the results. (See [OBJECTIVES.md](OBJECTIVES.md) for details.)

This is a Ruby implementation.

For the Crystal-lang implementation, see: https://github.com/drhuffman12/example_calculator_rb

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'example_calculator_rb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install example_calculator_rb

## Usage

To use in your Ruby code, add the following:

```ruby
require "example_calculator_rb"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
