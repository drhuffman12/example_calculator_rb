# Task 1

## Let’s get functional, functional.

We want to write calculations using functions and get the results.

Here are some examples:

```
six(times(five)) # must return 30
one(plus(nine)) # must return 10
six(minus(three)) # must return 3
eight(divided_by(two)) # must return 4
```

### Requirements:

* There must be a function for each number from 0 (“zero”) to 9 (“nine”)
* There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, divided_by
* Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
* The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand

### Guidelines

* Use Git and commit as often as you think is necessary to properly tell your story
* Write tests using RSpec proving that your solution works (TDD strongly encouraged)
* Use whatever tools you’d like (gems, patterns, etc)
* Engineer your solution as if there’s a high chance it will be re-used
* Keep lines wrapped at 120 characters
* Enjoy this challenge!

### How to submit

2 options:

* Upload to a public git repository on GitHub
* Zip the entire project, including the .git folder

Finally email me with your link or zip file.
